    "This python notebook has been written to give Sea-Bird Scientific (SBS) customers and the scientific community at large a set of python code to be used to process and analyze data from the CTD family of SBS instruments. This toolkit was made in conjunction with the Fathom project. Great care has been taken to make sure that the python code that makes up this toolkit and its related packages gives the same results as the Fathom application.\n",

Typically, Align CTD is used to align temperature, conductivity, and oxygen measurements relative to pressure.  \n",

    "\n",
    "Temperature and conductivity are often misaligned with respect to pressure. It can help to move the temperature and conductivity relative to pressure.  \n",

    "The best diagnostic of correct alignment is the removal of salinity spikes that align with very sharp temperature steps. To determine the best alignment, make a plot of 10 meters of temperature and salinity data at a depth that contains a very sharp temperature step. For the downcast, when temperature and salinity decrease with increased pressure:  \n",

    "For an SBE 19plus or 19plus V2 with a standard 2000-rpm pump, do not move conductivity.  \n",

    "Oxygen data is also systematically delayed with respect to pressure. The two primary causes are the long time constant of the oxygen sensor (for the SBE 43, ranging from 2 seconds at 25 ºC to approximately 5 seconds at 0 ºC) and an additional delay from the transit time of water in the pumped plumbing line. As with temperature and conductivity, you can move oxygen data relative to pressure to adjust for this delay.  \n",

If the input file has some variables with large values and some with relatively smaller values, it may be necessary to run Wild Edit more than once, and change the value for Keep data within this distance of mean so that it is meaningful for each variable. Increase Scans per block from 100 to approximately 500 to get better results.  "

A window length of 17 and halfwidth of 4 gives a set of filter weights that fills only half the window.
