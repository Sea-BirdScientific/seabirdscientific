This toolkit was made in conjunction with the Fathom project. Great care has been taken to make sure that the python code that makes up this toolkit and its related packages gives the same results as the Fathom application.\n",

This removes any time shifts caused by the filter.  \n",

    "This section shows how the Align CTD function aligns parameter data in time, relative to pressure, so that the calculated salinity, dissolved oxygen concentration, and other parameters are made with measurements from the same parcel of water. Typically, Align CTD is used to align temperature, conductivity, and oxygen measurements relative to pressure.  \n",
    "\n",
    "There are three principal causes of misalignment of CTD measurements:\n",
    "- physical misalignment of the sensors in depth\n",
    "- inherent time delay (time constants) of the sensor responses\n",
    "- water transit time delay in the pumped plumbing line - the time it takes the parcel of water to go through the plumbing to each sensor (or, for free-flushing sensors, the related flushing delay, which depends on profiling speed)  \n",
    "\n",
    "When measurements are correctly aligned, salinity spikes (and density) errors are minimized, and oxygen data agrees with the correct pressure (e.g., temperature vs. oxygen plots agree between down and up profiles).  \n",
    "\n",
    "### Conductivity and Temperature\n",
    "\n",
    "Temperature and conductivity are often misaligned with respect to pressure. It can help to move the temperature and conductivity relative to pressure.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The best diagnostic of correct alignment is the removal of salinity spikes that align with very sharp temperature steps. To determine the best alignment, make a plot of 10 meters of temperature and salinity data at a depth that contains a very sharp temperature step. For the downcast, when temperature and salinity decrease with increased pressure:  \n",
    "- A negative salinity spike at the conductivity step means that conductivity leads temperature (conductivity sensor sees step before temperature sensor does). Move conductivity relative to temperature a negative number of seconds.  \n",
    "- If the salinity spike is positive, move conductivity relative to temperature a positive number of seconds.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The best alignment of conductivity and temperature occurs when the salinity spikes are minimized. It may be necessary to try different intervals to find the best alignment.  \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Typical Temperature Alignment\n",
    "The SBE 19, 19plus, and 19plus V2 use a temperature sensor with a 0.5 second response time, which is slower than the conductivity sensor.\n",

    "#### Typical Conductivity Alignment\n",
    "For an SBE 19plus or 19plus V2 with a standard 2000-rpm pump, do not move conductivity.  \n",
    "However, if temperature is moved relative to pressure and you do not want to change the relative timing of temperature and conductivity, you must add the same interval to conductivity.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### Oxygen\n",
    "Oxygen data is also systematically delayed with respect to pressure. The two primary causes are the long time constant of the oxygen sensor (for the SBE 43, ranging from 2 seconds at 25 ºC to approximately 5 seconds at 0 ºC) and an additional delay from the transit time of water in the pumped plumbing line. As with temperature and conductivity, you can move oxygen data relative to pressure to adjust for this delay.  \n",

Wild Edit’s algorithm requires two passes through the data. The first pass gives an accurate estimate of the data’s true standard deviation, while the second pass replaces the appropriate data with badflag.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Wild Edit operates as follows:\n",
    "1. Compute the mean and standard deviation of data in block (specified by Scans per Block) for each selected variable. Temporarily flag values that differ from mean by more than standard deviations specified for pass 1.\n",
    "2. Recompute mean and standard deviation, and do not include temporarily flagged values. Identify the values that differ from the mean by more than standard deviations specified for pass 2 and replace the data value with badflag.\n",
    "3. Repeat Steps 1 and 2 for next block of scans. If the last block of data in the input file has less than specified number of scans, use data from previous block to fill in the block.  \n",
    "\n",
    "If the data file is particularly corrupted, you may need to do Wild Edit more than once, with different block sizes and number of standard deviations. If the input file has some variables with large values and some with relatively smaller values, it may be necessary to run Wild Edit more than once, and change the value for Keep data within this distance of mean so that it is meaningful for each variable. Increase Scans per block from 100 to approximately 500 to get better results.  "
