    "This python notebook has been created to give Sea-Bird customers and the scientific community at large a set of python code to be used in the processing and analysis of data from the CTD family of SBS instruments. This toolkit was developed in conjunction with the Orca project[<sup>1</sup>](#fn1). Great care has been taken to make sure that the python code that makes up this toolkit and its supporting packages produces the same results as the Orca application.\n",

    "This section shows how the Align CTD function aligns parameter data in time, relative to pressure. This ensures that calculations of salinity, dissolved oxygen concentration, and other parameters are made with measurements from the same parcel of water. Typically, Align CTD is used to align temperature, conductivity, and oxygen measurements relative to pressure.  \n",
    "\n",
    "There are three principal causes of misalignment of CTD measurements:\n",
    "- physical misalignment of the sensors in depth\n",
    "- inherent time delay (time constants) of the sensor responses\n",
    "- water transit time delay in the pumped plumbing line - the time it takes the parcel of water to go through the plumbing to each sensor (or, for free-flushing sensors, the corresponding flushing delay, which depends on profiling speed)  \n",
    "\n",
    "When measurements are correctly aligned, salinity spiking (and density) errors are minimized, and oxygen data corresponds to the proper pressure (e.g., temperature vs. oxygen plots agree between down and up profiles).  \n",
    "\n",
    "### Conductivity and Temperature\n",
    "\n",
    "Temperature and conductivity are often misaligned with respect to pressure. Shifting temperature and conductivity relative to pressure can compensate.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The best diagnostic of correct alignment is the removal of salinity spikes that coincide with very sharp temperature steps. To determine the best alignment, make a plot 10 meters of temperature and salinity data at a depth that contains a very sharp temperature step. For the downcast, when temperature and salinity decrease with increased pressure:  \n",
    "- A negative salinity spike at the conductivity step means that conductivity leads temperature (conductivity sensor sees step before temperature sensor does). Advance conductivity relative to temperature a negative number of seconds.  \n",
    "- Conversely, if the salinity spike is positive, advance conductivity relative to temperature a positive number of seconds.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The best alignment of conductivity with respect to temperature is obtained when the salinity spikes are minimized. Some experimentation with different advances is required to find the best alignment.  \n",

    "\n",
    "#### Typical Conductivity Alignment\n",
    "For an SBE 19plus or 19plus V2 with a standard 2000-rpm pump, do not advance conductivity.  \n",
    "However, if temperature is advanced relative to pressure and you do not want to change the relative timing of temperature and conductivity, you must add the same advance to conductivity.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### Oxygen\n",
    "Oxygen data is also systematically delayed with respect to pressure. The two primary causes are the long time constant of the oxygen sensor (for the SBE 43, ranging from 2 seconds at 25 ºC to approximately 5 seconds at 0 ºC) and an additional delay from the transit time of water in the pumped plumbing line. As with temperature and conductivity, you can compensate for this delay by shifting oxygen data relative to pressure.  \n",

    "## Wild Edit\n",
    "This section shows how the Wild Edit function marks wild points in the data by replacing the data value with a badflag value, by default -9.99e-29. Wild Edit’s algorithm requires two passes through the data. The first pass obtains an accurate estimate of the data’s true standard deviation, while the second pass replaces the appropriate data with badflag.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Wild Edit operates as follows:\n",
    "1. Compute mean and standard deviation of data in block (specified by Scans per Block) for each selected variable. Temporarily flag values that differ from mean by more than standard deviations specified for pass 1.\n",
    "2. Recompute mean and standard deviation, excluding temporarily flagged values. Mark values that differ from mean by more than standard deviations specified for pass 2 by replacing data value with badflag.\n",
    "3. Repeat Steps 1 and 2 for next block of scans.  If last block of data in input file has less than specified number of scans, use data from previous block to fill in block.  \n",
    "\n",
    "If the data file is particularly corrupted, you may need to run Wild Edit more than once, with different block sizes and number of standard deviations. If the input file has some variables with large values and some with relatively smaller values, it may be necessary to run Wild Edit more than once, varying the value for Keep data within this distance of mean so that it is meaningful for each variable. Better results may also be obtained by increasing Scans per block from 100 to around 500.  "

A window length of 9 and halfwidth of 4 produces a set of filter weights that fills the window. A window length of 17 and halfwidth of 4 produces a set of filter weights that fills only half the window. If the filter weights do not fill the window, the offset parameter may be used to shift the weights within the window without clipping the edge of the Gaussian curve.  \n",
